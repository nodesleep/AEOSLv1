## **AI-Enhanced Open Source License (AEOSL)**
Version 1.0, September 2024

### **Preamble**
This license is designed to promote the open sharing of software while ensuring that software developers retain control over how their work is used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The goal is to allow for the free and open use of software, with specific provisions that address the unique challenges and ethical considerations associated with AI.

### **1. Definitions**
- **"Software"**: Refers to the source code, object code, documentation, and other associated files covered under this license.
- **"AI System"**: Refers to any machine learning model, artificial intelligence, neural network, or any automated system that uses algorithms to process data, make decisions, or generate content.
- **"You" (or "Your")**: Refers to the licensee, the individual or entity using the Software under the terms of this license.
- **"Derivative Work"**: Refers to any modification, transformation, or adaptation of the Software, including any work that uses a significant portion of the Software.

       - The use of the Software in AI Systems must be acknowledged in any output or derivative work produced by the AI System, either by including a reference to the Software’s original authors or by providing a link to the original source code.
       - Any content, data, or models generated by AI Systems that are derived from the Software must be made available under the same license or a compatible open-source license.
     - **Ethical Use**: The Software may not be used in AI Systems intended for unethical applications, including but not limited to surveillance, autonomous weapons, systems that violate fundamental human rights, or systems that perpetuate bias or discrimination.

### **3. Distribution and Derivative Works**
- You may distribute copies of the Software, modified or unmodified, provided that:
  1. **License Inclusion**: This license must be included with all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
  2. **Same License**: Any derivative work must be licensed under this same AI-Enhanced Open Source License or a compatible open-source license.

### **4. Disclaimer of Warranty**
- The Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.
